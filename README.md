# Solar Power Generation Data

This data analysis and machine learning project investigates relationships between solar panel performance and environmental conditions for 2 solar panel arrays based in India, using a dataset made available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/anikannal/solar-power-generation-data).

Data has been gathered at two solar power plants in India over a 34 day period. Power generation datasets are gathered at the inverter level, with each inverter connected to multiple lines of solar panels, whilst sensor data is gathered at the plant level, with a single array of sensors optimally placed within the plant.
