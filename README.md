# Solar Panel Output Modelling

Introduction
---

This data analytics and predictive modelling project investigates the performance and behaviour of solar panels generating power for the Indian electrical power network, using datasets from two generation stations made available on Kaggle.

The project starts with data exploration and visualisation, followed by the development of models for predicting solar cell performance and detecting panels in need of maintenace using linear regression (sklearn) and neural networks (Keras API).

Data has been gathered at two solar power plants in India over a 34 day period. There are two datasets for each plant: One for power generation and one for environmental sensor readings. 

The power generation datasets are gathered at the inverter level, and each inverter has multiple lines of solar panels attached to it. The sensor data is gathered at plant level, with a single array of sensors optimally placed.

Project Objectives
---

Can we predict the power generation for next couple of days? - this allows for better grid management
Can we identify the need for panel cleaning/maintenance?
Can we identify faulty or suboptimally performing equipment?
