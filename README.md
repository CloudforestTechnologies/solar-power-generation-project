# Solar Panel Output Modelling

Introduction
---

This data analytics and predictive modelling project investigates the performance and behaviour of solar panels generating power for the Indian electrical power network, using datasets from two generation stations made available on Kaggle.

The project starts with data exploration and visualisation, followed by the development of models for predicting solar cell performance and detecting panels in need of maintenace using linear regression (sklearn) and neural networks (Keras API).
